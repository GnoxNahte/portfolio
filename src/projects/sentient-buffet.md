title: Sentient Buffet
slug: sentient-buffet # URL path
shortDescription: As a world renown chef, you can sometimes find yourself wandering the forest in search of ingredients. However, one day, in a route where you would normally be alone, you find yourself swarmed by living food that begin to attack you. Fight them off, and then cook them for stat buffs to help you venture further into the forest.

### Features that I did:
* Character Movement script:
    * I did the behaviours and the designer and artist changed the parameters like the speed / jump height
    * Editor:
    ![Character Movement Editor](../../public/images/SentientBuffet/SentientBuffet_MovementEditor.png)
* Dialogue System:
    * Designer gave the script in a design document and I implemented it. 
    * Note: Trying to convert the editor UI to UI toolkit to learn UI Toolkit and make it reusable in the future.
